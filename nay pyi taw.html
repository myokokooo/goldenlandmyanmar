<p class="para">Naypyidaw, officially spelled Nay Pyi Taw
is the capital city of Myanmar. It is administered as the Naypyidaw Union Territory, as per the Constitution. On 6 November 2005, the administrative capital of the country was quietly relocated from Yangon to a greenfield site about 320 km (200 mi) north of where it had been, with minimal explanation from the government. The new capital's official name was made public on 27 March 2006, Myanmar's Armed Forces Day. Construction of this planned city began in 2002 and was completed by 2012. Naypyidaw is notable for its unusual combination of large size and very low population density. The city hosted the 24th and 25th ASEAN Summit, the Ninth East Asia Summit, and the 2013 Southeast Asian Games.

<p class="para">

Naypyidaw is Burmese for "abode of the king", and is generally translated as "royal capital",[8]"seat of the king", or "abode of kings". Traditionally, it was used as a suffix to the names of royal capitals, such as Mandalay, which was called Yadanabon Naypyidaw.

<p class="para">

Naypyidaw has a short history. It was founded on a greenfield site near Pyinmana, about 320 kilometres (200 mi) north of the old capital, Yangon. Construction started in 2002.[4] At least 25 construction companies were hired by the military government to build the city, including Asia World and Htoo Ltd.[9] The military government began moving government ministries from Yangon to Naypyidaw on 6 November 2005 at the astrologically auspicious time of 6:37 a.m.[10]Five days later, on 11 November at 11 a.m., a second convoy of 1,100 military trucks carrying 11 military battalions and 11 government ministries left Yangon. The ministries were expected to be mostly in place by the end of February 2006; however, the hasty move led to a lack of schools and other amenities which separated the government employees from their families for the time being.

<p class="para">
 The government originally prohibited families of government workers from moving to the new capital.[11] Military headquarters were located in a separate compound from the government ministries, and civilians have been banned from entering either. Vendors are restricted to a commercial zone near the government offices.
On 27 March 2006, more than 12,000 troops marched in the new capital in its first public event: a massive military parade to mark Armed Forces Day—which is the anniversary of then Burma's 1945 uprising against the Japanese occupation of Burma. Filming was restricted to the concrete parade ground which contains three enormous sculptures—depictions of the Burmese kings Anawrahta, Bayinnaung and Alaungpaya, who are considered the three most important kings in Burmese history. The city was officially named Naypyidaw during these ceremonies.

<p class="para">
Naypyitaw is a Union Territory under the direct administration of the President. Day-to-day functions are carried out on the President's behalf by the Naypyidaw Council led by a Chairperson. The Chairperson and members of the Naypyitaw Council are appointed by the President and include both civilians and Armed Forces representatives.
On 30 March 2011, President TheinSeinappointed TheinNyunt as chairman of the Naypyitaw Council, along with 9 chair members: Than Htay, Colonel Myint Aung Than, Kan Chun, PaingSoe, Saw Hla, MyintSwe, MyintShwe and MyoNyunt.
The Naypyitaw Union Territory consists of the city proper (downtown) and eight surrounding townships. Downtown is further divided into four wards. Pyinmana, Lewe, and Tatkonetownships were all formerly part of Yamethin District. OatharaThiri, DekkinaThiri, PopphaThiri, ZapuThiri, and ZeyarThiri are all new townships currently under construction. As of December 2009, most government ministry offices have been relocated to the administrative capital. Only the offices of ministries' directorates remain in Yangon.

<p class="para">There is sometimes some controversy about land use and changes in land ownership related to the urban spread of Naypyitaw. In late 2014, for example, there were suggestions in parliament that land grabs were occurring near the Dekkhinathiri Township and that existing laws needed to be amended to provide better protection for farmers. There has also been criticism from some members of parliament about the size of the Naypyitaw Union Territory and the fact that money is being spent on urban infrastructure (such as lighting around lakes) although the facilities do not attract much use.
